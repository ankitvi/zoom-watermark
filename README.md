Abstract: No change in size, position or colour of watermark on zoom in/out of image. 
Developed for BISAG maps where such a feature is necessary(like Google Maps- even if you zoom in, the watermark size is still same and is regenerated in different positions). Here we regenerate in a fixed position(as per requirement)

BISAG = Bhaskaracharya Institute of Space Applications and Geo Informatics

Period of development: May - July 2012

Libraries used: OpenCV2.1
